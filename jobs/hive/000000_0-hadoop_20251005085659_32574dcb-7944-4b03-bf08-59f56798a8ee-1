反正那里钱多就去那里，之后嘛攒了一笔小钱，在佩罗高地便宜买了栋房子住了下来；那里地势不错内屋也宽敞，一个自称高手的残疾人找到了我和琉璃，说是有一笔大买卖，我也在想总是小打小闹什么时候才是个头，就和“琉璃”干了这一票。还不错，这一票比我们在外面乱混来的实在，就是个郊区小银行把里面的一个东西拿走就行，这事不难，三下五除二就搞定了；之后又有个自称探员的家伙找到了我们，让我们去劫狱。上次我们已经尝到了甜头了，不可能收手，于是就干了这一票，这一票让我认识了个叫“老k”的人，他其实是个公司的职员，会一些外国语言，做翻译工作，会开飞机枪法也不错。其实他是不满意只拿死工资就请了些日子的假来干一票。大家都满意了，之后也合作了几次我也觉得他这个人不错，重情义，性格温和，做事冷静。这些日子也认识了个叫小罗的人，他是个不起眼的角色，但是日后也有他的剧情，所以在这里说一下。,1,0,0.0
